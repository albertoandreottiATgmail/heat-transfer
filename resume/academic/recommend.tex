Dear Madam or Sir:\\
\\
I would like to recommend Alberto Andreotti for your PhD research
fellowships. Alberto was a student of mine in a postgraduate program in Distributed Systems
at the Faculty of Mathematics, Astronomy and Physics and a colleague of mine at Intel
Corporation.\\
As a student, he made insightful, interesting remarks on crucial concepts.
He did manage to complete our very demanding program being at the same time a full time
employee. Alberto showed remarkable dedication and enthusiasm.\\
At Intel, he helped me developing a novel knowledge representation
database based on message passing and graphs. Alberto contributed actively to the project
and was capable of dealing with the concepts and technology that were required and that
were novel to him.\\
I think he is the kind of student that will do very well in an international
research environment.\\
If you need any more details, I will be happy to provide them.\\
\\
Sincerely, 
\\
\\
Prof. Dr. Gabriel Infantel L\'opez\\
